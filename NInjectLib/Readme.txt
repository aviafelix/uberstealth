About N-InjectLib
N-InjectLib is a library written in C++ which allows for injecting dynamic link libraries into a remote (i.e. foreign) process.
Two techniques are available to inject a dll: the target process can be started by using the library so the first dll loaded actually is the dll to be injected, or dlls can be injected anytime while the target process is running.
